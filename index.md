## About

I am a PhD student in the Department of Molecular Ecology at the Max-Planck-Institute for Marine Microbiology in Bremen, Germany. My research focuses on computational projects within microbial ecology, with an emphasis on the **_Verrucomicrobiota_** phylum.

In my primary project, I study within-species variations of **_Verrucomicrobiota_** metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) collected during the Helgoland spring blooms over a 10-year period. This work aims to uncover fine-scale variations and dynamic patterns within these microbial communities. Additionally, I am characterizing a specific family of **_Verrucomicrobiota_** based on Helgoland MAGs, while investigating the differences between members of this phylum from various environmental sources. My research also took me to the South Atlantic, where I had the opportunity to collect surface water samples around South Georgia Island for community characterization.

I graduated in 2020 with a BSc in Biochemistry and Cell Biology, along with a minor in Earth and Environmental Sciences, from Jacobs University (now Constructor University). My undergraduate thesis, titled _“The Role of Dissolved Inorganic Phosphorus on the Growth and Elemental Composition of Globally Important N<sub>2</sub>-Fixing Microorganisms”_, was conducted at the Biogeochemistry Department of MPI in Bremen under the supervision of **Dr. Wiebke Mohr** and **Prof. Dr. Matthias Ullrich**.

I continued my studies at the MPI, completing a Master’s in Marine Microbiology in 2022. For my MSc thesis, titled _“Exploring Niche Differentiation in Functionally Similar Heterotrophic Bacteria During Phytoplankton Spring Blooms”_, I worked under the supervision of **Dr. Luis H. Orellana**. Following that, I began my PhD project with him and **Prof. Dr. Rudolf Amann** in April 2022.
