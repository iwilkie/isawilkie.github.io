## About

I am a doctoral candidate at the department of Molecular Ecology at the Max-Planck-Institute for Marine Microbiology in Bremen, Germany. My work is split into two projects, on one hand I examine within-species variations of _Verrucomicrobiota_ MAGs recovered from the Helgoland spring blooms over 10 years to examine their dynamics and fine-scale variations. Contrastingly, my other project aims to characterise the microbial community in water samples collected around the island of South Georgia and in the South Atlantic. My work is primarily bioinformatics-based, though from time to time some projects lead me back to the wet-lab.

I graduated with a BSc in Biochemistry and Cell Biology and minor in Earth and Environmental Sciences from Jacobs University (now called Constructor University)_ in 2020. My thesis project, entitled "The role of dissolved inorganic phosphorus on the growth and elemental composition of globally important N<sub>2</sub>-fixing microorganisms", was conducted at the Biogeochemistry department of the MPI in Bremen under the supervision of Wiebke Mohr. After my BSc, I continued my studies at the MPI in the Marine Microbiology MSc programme. I graduated in 2022 after having carried out my thesis project called "Exploring niche differentiation in functionally similar heterotrophic bacteria during phytoplankton spring blooms" under Luis H. Orellana's supervision, and subsequently started my doctoral project with him in April 2022.
